In general, views are read only.

We cannot perform write operations like updating, deleting & inserting rows in the base tables through views.

CREATE VIEW order_with_products AS
SELECT
  name,
  age
FROM
  user;

DROP VIEW view_name;


sub queries:

SELECT
   name,
   (
       SELECT AVG(rating)
       FROM product
       WHERE category = "WATCH"
   ) - rating AS rating_variance
FROM product
WHERE category = "WATCH";
